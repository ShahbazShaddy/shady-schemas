### **Web Data Source Integration Documentation**

#### **1. Data Source Overview**
- **Data Source Name:**  
  Dev.to Creator Verification  

- **Description:**  
  The Dev.to API endpoint allows for verifying if a user is marked as a creator on the Dev.to platform. This feature can help identify users who have been recognized as content creators.

---

#### **2. API Details**
- **API Endpoint URL:**  
  `https://dev.to/async_info/base_data`  

- **Request Method:**  
  `GET`  

- **Sample Response:**
  ```json
  {
      "broadcast": null,
      "param": "authenticity_token",
      "token": "some token",
      "user": "User info",
      "client_geolocation": "location",
      "default_email_optin_allowed": false,
      "creator": false
  }
  ```

#### **3. Technical Breakdown**
- **Purpose in zkPass Framework:**  
  By using the `creator` field from the Dev.to API response, zkPass can generate a zk-proof that verifies whether a user is a recognized creator on the platform, without exposing additional personal details such as `user` or `client_geolocation`.  

- **Authentication Method:**  
  This endpoint may require prior user authentication on Dev.to. zkPass should securely manage user sessions or tokens if necessary.  

- **Validation Logic:**  
  - Extract the `creator` field from the API response.  
  - Verify that its value is `true` to confirm the userâ€™s status as a creator.  

- **Security Considerations:**  
  - Avoid exposing sensitive fields such as `user` or `token`.  
  - Handle API responses securely, ensuring no sensitive data is stored beyond proof generation.
